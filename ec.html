  ENTREPRENEURIAL CREATIVITY<br>
   A high score in this area would suggest that what you would not like to give up is the opportunity to create an organization or enterprise of your own, built on your own
   abilities and your willingness to take risks and to overcome obstacles. You want to prove to the world that you can create an enterprise that is the result of your own efforts.
   You may be working for others in an organiztion while you are learning and assessing future opportunities, but you will go out on your own as soon as you feel you can manage it.
   You want your enterprise to be financially successful as proof of your abilities.
