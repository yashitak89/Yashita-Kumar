    YOU ARE TECHNICAL AND FUNCTIONAL<br>
    A high score in this area would suggest that what you would not liketo give up is the opportunity to apply your
    skills in this area and to continue to develop those skills and are most happy when your work permits you to be
    challenged in those areas. You may be willing to manage others in your technical or functional area, but you are
    not interested in management for its own sake and would avoid general management because you would have to leave
    your own area of expertise.
