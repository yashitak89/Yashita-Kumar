  PURE CHALLENGE<br>
  A high score in this area would suggest that what you would not like to give up is the opportunity to work on solutions to seemingly unsolvable problems,
  to win out over tough opponents, or to overcomedifficult obstacles. For you, the onyl meaningful reason for pursuing a job or career is that it permits
  you to win out over the impossible. Some people find such pure challenge is intellectual kinds of work such as the engineer who is only interested in
  impossibly difficult designs; some find the challenge in complex multifaceted situations such as the strategy consultant who is only interested in clients
  who are about to go brankrupt and have exhausted all other resources; some find it interpersonal competition such as the professional athlete ot the
  salesperson who defines every sale as either a win or loss. Novelty, variety and difficulty become ends in themselves, and if something is easy it becomes
  imeediately boring.
