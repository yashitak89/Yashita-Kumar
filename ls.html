    LIFESTYLE<br>
    A high score in this area would suggest that what you would not like to give up is a situation that permits you to balance and integrate your personal needs,
    your family needs and the requirements of your career. You want to make all the major sectors of your life work together towards an integrated whole, and you
    therefore need a career situation that provides enough flexibility to achieve such integration. You may have to sacrifice some aspects of the career(for example
    a geographical move that would be a promotion but would upset your total life situation) and you define success in terms broader that just career successes. You
    feel that your indentity is more tied up with how you live your total life, where you settle, how you deal with your family situation and how you develop yourself
    than any particular job or organization.
