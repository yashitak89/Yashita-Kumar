  SERVICE AND DEDICATION TO A CAUSE<br>
   A high score in this area would suggest that what you would not like to give up is to pursue work that achieves something of value, such as making the world a better place to live, solving environmental problems, improving harmony among people,
   helping others, improving people's safety, curing diseases through new producta and so on. You pursue such opportunities even if it means changing organizations, and you do not accept transfers or promotions that would take you out of work that fulfills
   those values.
