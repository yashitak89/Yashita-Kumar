  YOU ARE A GENERAL MANAGER<br>
  A high score in this area would suggest that what you woud not like to give up, is the opportunity to climb to a level high enough in the organization, to enable
  you to integrate the efforts of others across functions and to be responsible for the output of a particular unit of the organiztion. You want to be responsible
  and accountable for the total results and you are presently in a technical or functional area, you view that as a necessary learning experience; however, your
  ambition is to get a generalist job as soon as possible. Being at a high managerial level in a specialist function does not ineterest you.
